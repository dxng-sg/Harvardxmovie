# Harvardxmovie

This project is submitted to satisfy the module requirement for PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE IN DATA SCIENCE by HARVARDX.

The dataset used in this project came from the work of Harper & Konstan (2015). The dataset set is collected from a total of 71567 users, consists of 10000054 ratings, 95580 tags, and 10681 movies. The goal of the current project is to develop a model for the dataset, with prediction that results in low RMSE.

The key steps taken to reach the goal were: 1) dividing dataset into 'edx' dataset and 'validation' dataset, 2) exploring the 'edx' dataset and understanding the data structure, 3) identifying key variables, 4) sub-dividing 'edx' dataset into 'edx_train' set' and 'edx_test' set, 5) selecting the best linear combination model from the relevant variables, & finally 6) building a regularised linear model. The final regularised linear model is used to predict RMSE in the 'validation' set.
